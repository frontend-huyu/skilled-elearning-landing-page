## :black_nib: Overview
Hi, there! I'm Huyu. </br>
Thanks for checking out this solution to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q) challenge.</br>

## :wrench: Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Responsive web design for different screen sizes </br>
@media "<480px" / "480-768px" / "768-1280px" / ">1280" </br>
I took this CSS [Media Query Template](https://gist.github.com/mavieth/e0c8fdcb72a30d85f57a) just for my own reference.

## :hammer: I do this challenge with
- BEM Naming
- CSS Function
- Mobile-first responsive design </br>
I also used this [great solution](https://github.com/Bayoumi-dev/Skilled-e-learning-landing-page) as a reference.

## :scroll: There's room for improvement
- use vw/vh, rem units
- use CSS Function skillfully
- use vendor-prefixed properties(-webkit-/-moz-/-o-/-ms-)
- use utility-first frameworks(Tailwind CSS)
